# REAL_TIME_EMBEDDED_SYSTEM
STOPWATCH CLOUD AND PROTEUS INTERFACE
This project showcases the development of a smartwatch using FreeRTOS for efficient task management. The hardware components include an OLED display for displaying real-time clock information, a heart rate sensor for continuous monitoring, and an accelerometer for accurate step count tracking. To optimize power consumption, the smartwatch incorporates a manual display activation button and an automatic display-off function after 30 seconds of inactivity.

The nodemcu or ESP32 module serves as the controller, leveraging its integrated WiFi capabilities. This enables seamless transmission of sensor data to the cloud for remote monitoring through a web application. The Arduino Cloud interface enhances user interaction and provides a convenient platform for data visualization. The integration of FreeRTOS ensures responsive multitasking, allowing the smartwatch to efficiently manage various tasks simultaneously.

This open-source project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for developing a feature-rich smartwatch with emphasis on power efficiency, real-time health monitoring, and cloud connectivity. Developers can explore the codebase, hardware schematics, and simulation files in Proteus to gain insights into building their own smartwatches or contribute to further enhancements.
